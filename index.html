          <h3>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons</h3>
          <h4>OCT 14-16 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest
            conductor Aram Demirjian present a powerhouse program highlighted by
            Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking
            and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures
            the essence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through music that
            manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its debut.
            Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in
            its return to Boettcher Concert Hall.
          </p>

            The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously
            structured meditation on fate that endures as one of his most
            popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements,
            Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of
            humanity’s most powerful works of art. Among today’s best and
            brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit
            of dance, movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic
            celebration that will have you on the edge of your seat.

          <h3>Beethoven Symphony No. 3 with Peter Oundjian</h3>
          <h4>NOV 4-6 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            History is replete with turning points and with the completion of
            his revolutionary Third Symphony, Beethoven forever changed the idea
            of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and
            Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means
            to be human in a work that is larger and more emotional than a
            symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to
            the forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very
            nature of humanity, while reimagining a future for music filled with
            endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher
            Career Grant recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello
            Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring themes and
            quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado
            Symphony Chorus takes center stage on Vaughan Williams’ Walt
            Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable marriage of
            music and text, with Williams’ inspired music perfectly
            encapsulating Whitman’s noble, humanistic aspirations. These works
            will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your
            Colorado Symphony.

          <h3>Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with Olga Kern</h3>
          <h4>DEC 2-4 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic
            compositions — placed himself among the greats of the keyboard with
            the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with
            towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable
            Romantic spirit. For pianists what Everest is to climbers, the
            Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all
            virtuosos must measure themselves, featuring iconic opening
            flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite Olga
            Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this
            cornerstone of the Classical Canon. Your Colorado Symphony and
            Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San
            Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s
            stormy and brooding Tenth Symphony. Written to symbolize the power
            of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and complex
            orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet
            oppression. Ending on a triumphant note, this is a finale that will
            leave you breathless.

          <h3>Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé</h3>
          <h4>JAN 13-15 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits
            listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, which he called a
            “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense
            of powerful, dramatic music which defies category and springs to
            life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score creates a
            sensuous atmosphere with a lingering explosiveness residing just
            underneath the surface. Scored for a massive orchestra and utilizing
            the ethereal, intangible tones of a wordless chorus, Ravel often
            spotlights solo players in a way that recalls chamber music rather
            than merely using it as a show of force, pulling listeners into a
            vast, visceral dreamscape of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion.
            Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of
            Concertmaster Yumi Hwang-Williams, who brings expressive virtuosity
            to one of the first violin concertos of the modern era. The program
            opens with Lili Boulanger’s D’un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a
            spring morning,’ capturing the genius of this prodigious composer
            who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age
            of just 24. This sweet and playful ode to spring is just the
            transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.

          <h3>Beethoven Symphony No. 8</h3>
          <h4>FEB 10-12 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            Beethoven’s Eighth — which he referred to as “my little Symphony in
            F,”— is the most cheery, joyful, and experimental of his symphonies.
            Its relatively compact scale allowed Beethoven to be more
            imaginative and structurally radical than he could dare to be on the
            larger canvases of his other symphonies. Light-hearted and full of
            charm, the Eighth is an often-overlooked gem that will shine under
            the baton of Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon. Celebrate the
            Colorado Symphony Horns as they take center stage on Schumann’s
            Konzertstück for 4 Horns and Orchestra, incorporating the warmth,
            nobility, and hunting-horn origins of German Romantic-era music
            while conjuring images of the unspoiled forests of the German
            landscape. In an ironic twist, the performance begins with a
            “Farewell,” harkening back to the piece’s debut when Haydn
            instructed his musicians to stop playing one by one during the final
            movement, snuff out the candle on their music stand, and walk off
            the stage in turn, leaving just two violins to convey the final
            notes. In this uniquely imaginative performance, seeing is
            believing.

          <h3>Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto</h3>
          <h4>February 24-26 FRI-SAT 730 SUN 1</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most accomplished of all piano works, Beethoven’s
            “Emperor” Concerto features a striking opening movement and a
            glorious finale, with beauty and virtuosic style throughout that
            makes it one of the composer’s best. Your Colorado Symphony welcomes
            electrifying pianist Stewart Goodyear who is just the firebrand to
            live up to the wiles of this majestic and vigorously demanding
            concerto. Teddy Abrams — Musical America’s 2022 Conductor of the
            Year — brings dynamic flair to Perkinson’s energetic Worship
            Overture. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony was so well received that
            within months of its American premiere, a portrait of the composer
            was featured on the cover of Time magazine. Prokofiev wrote that he
            “conceived of it as glorifying the grandeur of the human spirit,
            praising the free and happy man— his strength, his generosity, and
            the purity of his soul." This heroic and joyous work offers a
            brilliant conclusion to a performance of energizing masterworks.

          <h4>March 10th-12th FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            One of the foremost conductors of his generation, Alexander Shelley
            joins your Colorado Symphony for a program that will leave you
            simply spellbound. Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo’s classical
            guitar concerto Concierto de Aranjuez fills the concert hall with
            the immortal sounds and traditions of Spanish romanticism in a
            must-hear interpretation from guitar virtuoso Pablo Sainz Villegas
            who was hailed as “The global ambassador of Spanish guitar” by
            Billboard Magazine. Anna Clyne’s This Midnight Hour is mysterious
            and foreboding, with musical twists and turns that show why she is
            considered one of the preeminent composers of our time. Bartók’s
            Concerto for Orchestra was called a concerto rather than a symphony
            as each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and
            virtuosic way, combining elements of Western art music and Hungarian
            folk songs in a stirring finale to an evening of symphonic
            sublimity.

          <h3>Brahms Requiem with Peter Oundjian</h3>
          <h4>Mar 24–26 FRI–SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            Unlike other Requiem Masses, Brahms’ A German Requiem is not
            primarily a Mass for the dead. Instead, it is intended as comfort
            and solace for those left behind as they mourn the death of others.
            Confronting life as much as it does death, Brahms further
            differentiates his Requiem by setting excerpts from the Lutheran
            Bible and apocrypha in German instead of the Catholic, Latin text
            used in the Requiem Masses by Mozart, Verdi, and Berlioz. The
            Colorado Symphony Chorus and two vocal soloists lend distinction to
            this stunning masterpiece, which remains one of the most revered
            choral works ever composed. A taste for the exotic surfaces often in
            the catalogue of Maurice Ravel and his orchestral song cycle
            Shéhérazade is no exception. Named for the protagonist of One
            Thousand and One Nights, Shéhérazade is a woman who employs her
            imagination as a means of escape. "Je voudrais voir...", she
            repeats, meaning "I would like to see...", this refrain sets the
            tone for Ravel’s song cycle which drips with color evoking images of
            the far east. Drawing on music from the opera, Weber’s Overture to
            Oberon is a celebration of the supernatural realm. Like in Mozart's
            The Magic Flute, Weber establishes Oberon's horn as a mystical
            instrument and its call as a leitmotif throughout the overture,
            unleashing an exuberant conversation between instrumental voices and
            concluding with a virtuosic flourish conducted by Maestro Peter
            Oundjian.

          <h3>Beethoven Violin Concerto</h3>
          <h4>Apr 21-23 Fri & Sat 7:30 Sunday 1:00</h4>
          <p>
            Join your Colorado Symphony and Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian
            in welcoming acclaimed soloist and 2021 Gramophone Artist of the
            Year, James Ehnes, to Boettcher Concert Hall for a reinvigoration of
            Beethoven’s majestic Violin Concerto. Beethoven’s output in nearly
            every musical genre was prolific, yet surprisingly he wrote only one
            concerto for the violin. The four opening drum taps that begin this
            masterpiece remain one of the most surprising and audacious ideas
            that the composer ever committed to paper, setting the stage for a
            transcendent work that stands among the greats of the repertoire.
            Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony emphatically elevated him into the ranks
            of legendary 19th century composers in a work that is epic in scope
            and scale, with knowing nods to Beethoven’s Third Symphony and
            Wagner’s Ring Cycle, including his use of the famous Wagner tubas.
            This revered work caps an awe-inspiring program of inspiring
            masterworks led by Maestro Oundjian.
