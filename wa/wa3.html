        <h2>In Real Application</h2>

        <article>
          <p>A <strong>tessellation</strong> or tiling is the covering of a surface, often a plane, using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles,
             <strong>no overlaps and no gaps</strong> . In mathematics, tessellation can be generalized to higher dimensions and a variety of geometries.</p>
          <p>A periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include regular tilings with regular polygonal tiles all of the same shape, 
            and semiregular tilings with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by 
            periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called "non-periodic". 
            An aperiodic tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern (an aperiodic set of prototiles). 
            A tessellation of space, also known as a space filling or honeycomb, can be defined in the geometry of higher dimensions.</p>
          <p>
          A real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. 
          Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, 
          floor, or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art such as in the Moroccan 
          architecture and decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. 
          Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, 
          for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. 
          Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.

        <p>Tessellations were used by the <strong>Sumerians</strong> (about 4000 <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr> ) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.</p>   
        <p>Decorative mosaic tilings made of small squared blocks called <strong>tesserae</strong> were widely employed in classical antiquity, 
           sometimes displaying geometric patterns.</p>
        <p>In 1619, Johannes Kepler made an early documented study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his
            Harmonices Mundi; he was possibly the first to explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and snowflakes.</p>
        <p> Some two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer Yevgraf Fyodorov proved that every periodic tiling of the plane 
            features one of seventeen different groups of isometries.[8][9] Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical 
            study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Alexei Vasilievich Shubnikov and Nikolai Belov (1964),
            and Heinrich Heesch and Otto Kienzle <time datetime="1963">(1963)</time>.</p>
