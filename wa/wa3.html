        Tessellations were used by the <strong>Sumerians</strong> (about 4000
        <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr> ) in building wall decorations
        formed by patterns of clay tiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decorative mosaic tilings made of small squared blocks called
        <strong>tesserae</strong> were widely employed in classical antiquity,
        sometimes displaying geometric patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1619, Johannes Kepler made an early documented study of
        tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in
        his Harmonices Mundi; he was possibly the first to explore and to
        explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and snowflakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer
        Yevgraf Fyodorov proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features
        one of seventeen different groups of isometries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical
        study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Alexei
        Vasilievich Shubnikov and Nikolai Belov (1964), and Heinrich Heesch and
        Otto Kienzle <time datetime="1963">(1963)</time>.

          A <strong>tessellation</strong> or tiling is the covering of a
          surface, often a plane, using one or more geometric shapes, called
          tiles, <strong>no overlaps and no gaps</strong> . In mathematics,
          tessellation can be generalized to higher dimensions and a variety of
          geometries.
        </p>
        <p>
          A periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include
          regular tilings with regular polygonal tiles all of the same shape,
          and semiregular tilings with regular tiles of more than one shape and
          with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by
          periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 wallpaper groups. A tiling
          that lacks a repeating pattern is called "non-periodic". An aperiodic
          tiling uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating
          pattern (an aperiodic set of prototiles). A tessellation of space,
          also known as a space filling or honeycomb, can be defined in the
          geometry of higher dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as
          cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative
          patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and
          water-resistant pavement, floor, or wall coverings. Historically,
          tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art such as in
          the Moroccan architecture and decorative geometric tiling of the
          Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher
          often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry
          and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are
          sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations
          form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of
          hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.

          The honeycomb is a well-known example of tessellation in nature with
          its hexagonal cells.
        </p>
        <p>
          In botany, the term "tessellate" describes a checkered pattern, for
          example on a flower petal, tree bark, or fruit. Flowers including the
          fritillary,[83] and some species of Colchicum, are characteristically
          tessellate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many patterns in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials.
          These patterns can be described by Gilbert tessellations,[85] also
          known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a
          mathematical model for the formation of mudcracks, needle-like
          crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar
          Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from being randomly scattered
          over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along
          a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random,
          creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons.[87] Basaltic
          lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction
          forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks
          that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of
          such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern
          Ireland.[88] Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which
          is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a
          rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into
          rectangular blocks.
